# Gentelella Theme on Phoenix 1.3

## NOTE: Still a WIP!

So far, only `plain.html` has been ported.

- [ ] Add missing JavaScript from plain.html
- [ ] Extract partials

## Starting

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
